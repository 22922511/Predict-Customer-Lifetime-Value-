Predict Customer Lifetime Value 


## Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction from Retail Data
This project demonstrates how to predict the future value of customers based on their historical retail transaction data. Predicting Customer Lifetime Value is crucial for businesses to optimize marketing efforts, improve customer retention, and maximize profitability.

Overview
The project uses real-world retail data containing invoice transactions, product details, purchase quantities, prices, timestamps, customer IDs, and country information. The main goal is to estimate how much revenue a customer will generate during their entire relationship with the business.

Features
Data Loading and Cleaning: Handle missing values, convert date fields, and correct data types for analysis.

Feature Engineering:

Calculate total spending per transaction.

Extract purchase frequency and recency metrics.

Aggregate features such as total spend, number of purchases, average purchase price, and active months per customer.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize purchase trends and customer behavior.

Analyze distribution of customer spending and frequency.

Modeling:

Build and evaluate machine learning models (e.g., regression, gradient boosting) to predict CLV.

Use historical customer behavior to forecast future revenue.

Interpretability & Business Insights:

Understand key factors driving customer value.

Provide actionable insights for targeted marketing campaigns and loyalty programs.

Technologies & Libraries
Python 3.x

pandas, numpy for data manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn for data visualization

scikit-learn, xgboost for modeling

Jupyter Notebook for iterative analysis and presentation

Dataset
The dataset includes fields like:

Invoice number

Stock code and product description

Quantity and price of items purchased

Invoice date and time

Customer ID and country

How to Use
Clone the repository

Load and preprocess the dataset

Run feature engineering scripts to prepare data for modeling

Train predictive models to estimate CLV

Analyze results and generate business insights

Future Work
Incorporate customer demographics and external data sources

Experiment with deep learning models for time-series customer behavior

Develop an interactive dashboard for real-time CLV monitoring
